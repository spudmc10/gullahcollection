## About the Collection

Collection of resources both available virtually and from personal data gathering concerning Gullah Geecheee. 
The current project seeks to gather contemporary expressions of Gullah Geechee together with historical representations
to let visitors experience the language across time and space. 

Future exhibits will incorporate a timeline of current events in Charleston (e.g. the removal of the John C. Calhoun statue, BLM and local activism) that have affected the tourism landscape of the area. Also will include visual artifacts of the (touristic) linguascape to build a more comprehensive view of the tourism environment.
